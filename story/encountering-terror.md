title: "Encountering Terror"
---

The group stopped. They felt something. An overwhelming presence like none else. It was coming closer. No one could move. They were afraid of what was ahead. They forgot to breath. Then Akhlus snapped out of it, grabbed Khaos and Styx, and hid behind the trees, leaving the
forest's path. This lead to Khaos and Styx also regaining their composure. No one could say a
word. They tried to get a glance at the origin of their fear and poked their heads out from
behind the trees.
A little girl was slowly walking where the group was, just seconds ago. No taller
than a dwarf, slender, frail. She had white long hair and wore a plain white dress. The girl
stopped in her tracks. After standing still for a moment, she looked over to the group, to
Khaos in particular. They once again froze. What was looking at them was no mere girl.
It felt like the end of the world was standing in front of them. A walking disaster. Terror.
[???]: ...
The girl tilted her head slightly. Her face was void of emotions. Her deep black eyes were
more terrifying than anything they had ever seen.
Silence.
Nothing happened for what felt like an eternity to the group.
A small smirk appeared on the girls face.
The group fainted.
